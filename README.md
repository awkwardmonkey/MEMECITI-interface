# Memeland: Coming Soon to the Memeverse!

Memeland is an upcoming sensation in the Memeverse! The development is being carried out using a robust and powerful tech stack to ensure you have an unprecedented experience in the Memeverse.

## Tech Stack Overview:

- **Quasar**: Our UI is built using Quasar, a high-performance, feature-packed UI component library that offers responsive design and a wealth of pre-built components.
  
- **Vue.js**: The UI comes alive with Vue.js, a modern and versatile JavaScript framework that allows us to create an intuitive and reactive user interface.
  
- **Babylon.JS**: For a top-notch, immersive gaming experience, we're using Babylon.JS. This powerful, feature-packed 3D game engine allows us to create stunning and highly interactive virtual environments.

## Development Tools:

We're using some of the most robust and efficient tools in our development process:

- **Webpack**: For bundling our application and managing dependencies, we use Webpack. It ensures that our application is optimized and ready to run smoothly.
  
- **Babel**: Our code is compiled using Babel, a JavaScript compiler that helps us use the latest language features while ensuring compatibility with different browser environments.
  
- **ESLint**: To maintain high code quality and adherence to best practices, we use ESLint. It helps us catch errors and maintain a consistent code style across the project.
  
- **Jest**: We believe in thorough testing, and for that, we use Jest. It's a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications.

## Compatibility

This interface is tested and validated for the following browser platforms:
* Mobile, Tablet, Desktop
    * Chromium (Chrome, Brave, etc.)
    * Webkit (Safari)
    * Gecko (Firefox)

### Install the dependencies

```sh
npm i
```
or
```sh
yarn
```

## Run, Compile, and Test

### Start the app in development mode

Development mode benefits from features like hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.

```sh
npm run dev
```
or
```
yarn run dev
```

### Lint the files
